# Cookie Consent Feature

This project implements a simple cookie consent banner using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The consent banner allows users to accept or decline the use of cookies on the website, and stores their preference in the browser cookies for one day.

## Features

- **Cookie Banner**: Displays a banner to users asking them to accept or decline cookies.
- **Cookie Storage**: Stores the user's consent preference in a cookie that lasts for one day.
- **Show/Hide Banner**: Automatically hides the cookie banner once the user gives their consent.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML structure for the cookie consent banner.
- **cookie.css**: Stylesheet that defines the appearance of the cookie consent banner.
- **myscript.js**: JavaScript file to handle the cookie setting and consent logic.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, a cookie consent banner will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
2. The user can either accept or decline cookies by clicking the respective button.
3. If the user accepts cookies, a cookie named `cookie` with a value of `rishabpradhan` is set, and it will expire after one day.
4. The banner is hidden once the user makes a choice, and it won't be shown again until the cookie expires.

## JavaScript Logic

The `myscript.js` file contains the logic to display the banner and set cookies:

- **`document.cookie`**: Used to store the user's consent choice.
- **Event Listeners**: Added to the "Accept" and "Decline" buttons to manage user actions.
- **Cookie Expiration**: Set for one day using the `expires` attribute.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and open the project directory.
2. Ensure that you have the following files:
   - `index.html`
   - `cookie.css`
   - `myscript.js`
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to test the cookie consent feature.
